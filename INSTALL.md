# Additional Notes

### For MatCaffe implememtation:
Caffeâ€™s MATLAB interface works with versions 2015a, 2014a/b, 2013a/b, and 2012b.
CMake fails for MATLAB build
Build using Make after relevant changes to Makefile.config

`make all`
`make matcaffe`
`make test`
`make mattest`
`make runtest`

Creating symbolic links where necessary in bin/glnxa64 solves most "cannot find -l<nameOfTheLibrary>" issues:

Edit initCaffe.m for appropriate gpu_id

### For PyCaffe implementation:
Run the following:
`make pycaffe`
`make runtest`

Edit initCaffe.py for appropriate gpu_id

Install modules that are imported for the project:
python3-scipy
python3-skimage
