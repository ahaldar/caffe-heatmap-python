# Caffe-heatmap-python

This is a fork of Caffe that enables training of heatmap regressor ConvNets for the general problem of regressing (x,y) positions in images, using the PyCaffe interface with Python3.


## Pretrained models
- [Fusion model trained on FLIC](http://tomas.pfister.fi/models/caffe-heatmap-flic.caffemodel)
- [Fusion model trained on ChaLearn](http://tomas.pfister.fi/models/caffe-heatmap-chalearn.caffemodel)

## Pre-cropped images and training labels for FLIC
- [Training](http://tomas.pfister.fi/flic_train_cropped_multfact282.tgz)
- [Testing](http://tomas.pfister.fi/flic_test_cropped_multfact282.tgz)
- Note these files require multfact=282 in both training and testing data layers

## Testing instructions

python/pose/demo.m provides example code for running the FLIC model on a video.


# Caffe

Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind.
It is developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center ([BVLC](http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu)) and community contributors.
